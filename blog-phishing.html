    <h1>What is Phishing and How to Protect Yourself</h1>
    <p><strong>Published on:</strong> October 2023</p>
    <p>Phishing is a type of cyberattack where attackers impersonate legitimate entities (e.g., banks, companies) to trick users into revealing sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, or Social Security numbers.</p>
    <h3>How Phishing Works</h3>
    <p>Attackers often use emails, fake websites, or malicious links to deceive victims. For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You receive an email claiming to be from your bank asking you to "verify" your account details.</li>
      <li>You click a link that takes you to a fake website designed to look like your bank's login page.</li>
      <li>You enter your credentials, which are then stolen by the attacker.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to Protect Yourself</h3>
    <p>To avoid falling victim to phishing attacks:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Always verify the sender's email address before clicking links.</li>
      <li>Hover over links to check their actual destination.</li>
      <li>Never share sensitive information via email or unsecured websites.</li>
      <li>Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) on your accounts.</li>
    </ol>
